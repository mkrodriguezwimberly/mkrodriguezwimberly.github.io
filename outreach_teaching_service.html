									<p>I primarily conduct astronomy outreach focusing on underrepresented minorities and K-12 Special Needs students (including children on the Autism Spectrum and those with Down Syndrome). Here are some examples of outreach work I've done.</p>

											<p>For children diagnosed with <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/autism-spectrum-disorders-asd/index.shtml#part_145441"> Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), the National Institute of Mental Health</a> prescribes focused and challenging learning activies that provide a high degree of structure, communication and social skills such as pretend play. Many astronomy activities geared for young children fit this prescription perfectly! I have organized in-class visits with students who have ASD and students with Down Syndrome. I led the students in learning activities such as creating tin foil comets and demonstrations such as making a dry ice comet.</p>

											<p> Myself and another UCI Physics &amp; Astronomy Graduate Student, Arianna Brown organized a department supported Public Eclipse Event for the Great American Eclipse on August 21, 2017. It was quite the success! We had >1000 attendees (an audience only paralled by the Nobel Laureate Dedication in 1995) and >500 livestream viewers. Our event was covered by local news (OC register) outlets such as the <a href="https://www.ocregister.com/2017/08/16/uci-to-host-great-american-eclipse-public-viewing-party-monday/">OC Register</a>, <a href="http://ktla.com/2017/08/21/uc-irvine-draws-hundreds-for-eclipse-viewing-party/">KTLA</a> and <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/slideshow/americans-look-skies-glasses-solar-eclipse-n794541">NBC</a>. </p>

										<h2 class="major">Teaching &#38; Service</h2>
										<p>While I was in the Master's of Science Program at <a href="http://www.csulb.edu">Cal State Long Beach</a>, I instructed <a href="http://catalog.csulb.edu/preview_entity.php?catoid=2&ent_oid=210">Intro to Astronomy Lab</a> for two semesters. This is a stand-alone lab class. I developed the syllabus using the provided text which contained in-class experiments. Additionally, I created, assigned and graded homework, quizzes, exams and a mid-term project.</p> 
										<p>Currently, I am the <a href="https://www.astrosociety.org/about-us/board-of-directors/#board_officers">Junior Board Fellow</a> on the <a href="https://www.astrosociety.org">Astronomical Society of the Pacific's</a> Board of Directors. With the ASP, I work with the Staff and Board Directors to help diversity astronomy and make it an inclusive environment for all! </p>
										<p>Additionally at my home institution, I serve on UCI Physics &#38; Astronomy's Inclusive Excellence Committee and their Physics Graduate Caucaus. (Websites coming soon!) Through these groups, I am working to create and revitalize peer mentoring programs within the Physics &#38; Astronomy Department. </p>
