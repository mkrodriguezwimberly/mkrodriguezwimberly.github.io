							<p><strong>Hello!</strong> I'm an Assistant Professor at California State University, San Bernardino in the Department of Physics and Astronomy. I study near–field cosmology and galaxy evolution using both optical telescopes and cosmological simulations. In particular, my work on ultra–faint dwarf galaxies — researching these possible relics of the first galaxies ever formed to learn more about the early universe, how the earliest galaxies evolve, and how they can be used as a tool to learn more about our own galaxy, the Milky Way.</p>

							<p>Alongside this astrophysics research, I work to improve the astronomical community for all. I am the Director of Mentorship for the <a href="https://calbridge.org/">Cal-Bridge</a> Program — a California state-wide scholarship and professional development program for STEM undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. Additionally, I am on the Board of Directors for the <a href="https://www.astrosociety.org">Astronomical Society of the Pacific</a> — the oldest astronomical society in the country and leader in astronomy outreach. My aim is to normalize a holistic approach to academic success and strengthen marginalized communities.</p>

							<p>Aside from all things astro, I'm enjoying my new life role as a mama! Family time with the husband, and two daughters is my favorite hobby — this includes lots of laughs, hikes and baby snuggles!</p>

										<h2 class="major">Research</h2>
										<p>My work focuses at the intersection of the build up of passive galaxies over cosmological time and small scale challenges to &Lambda;CDM to learn more about the tiniest and oldest galaxies known - ultra-faint dwarf galaxies. I employ big data analysis techniques in the interface of optical wavelength observations and theory (namely cosmological simulations). You can learn more about my published work in the links below.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Teaching &amp; Service</h2>
										<p>I am deeply grateful for the excellent mentorship I have received from both faculty and peers throughout my academic career. I've now made it part of my mission to pay this forward. <!-- During my second year as a graduate student at University of California, Irvine I initiated and then co-created an organization of graduate student peer mentoring programs in my department, <a href="https://uci-pace.github.io/index.html">Physics and Astronomy Community Excellence Program</a>, that has now influenced multiple programs outside my university and has been awarded external and internal funding awards. I took this gained expertise to create and institutionalize a peer mentorship program for undergraduate STEM scholars in the <a href="https://calbridge.org/">Cal-Bridge</a> Program, of which I am an alum of their first scholar cohort. In addition to this work within student groups to improve the lives of my peers, I am on the <a href="https://astrosociety.org/who-we-are/board/">Board of Directors at the Astronomical Society of the Pacific</a> where I serve as the Diversity Committee Co-chair with the mission to help bring the ASP's vast STEM educational and outreach resources to astronomy graduate and undergraduate students.--> I have created, and co-created, multiple peer mentorship programs that are now institutionalized with their respective programs. In addition to leadership roles I hold within scholarship and professional astronomical societies, I serve as the faculty advisor the the CSUSB Society of Physics Students. </p>
										<p>At Cal State San Bernardino I teach a variety of undergraduate physics and astronomy courses, including Mathematical Methods for Physicists, Tools for Physicists, and Introduction to Galaxies and Cosmology. In each course, I utilize multiple evidence-based pedagogical techniques to ensure each class is interactive, provide students with multiple ways to engage with the course content, and effectively teach every student. </p> 
									<!--	<p> I have instructed <a href="http://catalog.csulb.edu/preview_entity.php?catoid=2&ent_oid=210">Intro to Astronomy Labs</a> at  <a href="http://www.csulb.edu">Cal State Long Beach</a> where I crafted all parts of the course as the instructor on record. Teaching these labs and serving as a Learning Assistant at CSULB were terrific experiences. I now use active learning and open ended questioning techniques in peer mentoring workshops. Additionaly, I am the <a href="https://www.astrosociety.org/about-us/board-of-directors/#board_officers">Junior Board Fellow</a> on the <a href="https://www.astrosociety.org">Astronomical Society of the Pacific's</a> Board of Directors, I serve on UCI Physics &#38; Astronomy Inclusive Excellence Committee and their Physics Graduate Caucaus. </p> -->

										<h2 class="major">Outreach &amp; Science Communication</h2>
										<p>I have conducted astronomy outreach focusing on underrepresented minorities and primarily with K-12 Special Needs students (including children on the Autism Spectrum and those with Down Syndrome). I'm also passionate about using various social media platforms to meet young folks where they are, spread astronomy knowledge and encourage them to follow their dreams. Come join me!</p>

										<h2 class="major">About me!</h2>
										<p>My path to astronomy has some fun twists and turns. I grew up in Southern California and while I was interested in math in high school, I was discouraged against pursuing any STEM related field in college. As a 16 year old, this set me on a determined path to discover what I was passionate enough about to dedicate my life/career to. At first it was acting. To support myself after high school in this unsteady field, I joined the Army Reserves Band playing the alto and baritone saxophones! While attending community college full time and serving in the Reserves, I worked full time at Disneyland as an entertainer! As my acting dreams were starting to come to fruition, I realized they type of work required to improve my craft was not the type of work I am impassioned by. After a heavy dose of SciFi TV inspiration (Captain Katherine Janeway to be exact), I decided to pursue my childhood STEM dream!</p>
										<p>At the age where many of my peers had graduated college and were starting their careers and families, I started on my astronomical path. First, I attended California State University, Long Beach where I earned a Physics BS, then completed one year of their Physics MS program and earned my Physics PhD at the University of California, Irvine. I was an astrophysics postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Riverside and am now faculty at California State University, San Bernardino. I may not practice my saxophone much anymore but music still fills my home and Disneyland is still one of my favorite places to visit with my husband and two daughters.</p>
